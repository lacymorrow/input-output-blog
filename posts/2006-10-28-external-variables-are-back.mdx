...And this time, no bugs! You are now able to use external variables in a text file with your players, to replace the long strings of variables in you html. One file can be used with however many players you need. Just replace the paragraph or two of 'www.mydomain.com/xspf\_player.swf?playlist\_url=playlist.xml&alphabetize=true&autoplay=1' etc. with 'www.mydomain.com/xspf\_player.swf?loadurl=variables.txt', Using 'loadurl' as your sole variable. This finishes my planned work for the XSPF, but I still have a lot to do. I'm deciding on whether to build a skin formatter, for users to create their own layouts, or new downloadable versions with different looks, or both. See it [here](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf).

The playlist creator is now open-source and up for download. For those looking into the scripting side of flash, this is a good example of flash forms and text manipulation.
