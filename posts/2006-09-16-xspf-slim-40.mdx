The new version of the slim player is up and about, with the same external variables ability as it's big brother. The new big thing here though is another innovation from my blossoming flash years and my jukebox, id3 tag support. id3 tags were not usable in the extended version because of the displaying of all artists and titles in the playlist. However, with id3 tags, no artist or title is needed. Information is stored is 98% of alll mp3's, including artist and song titles. The tags show automatically when there is no titles present, or use the variable "&useId3=1" to have them always show. As well as that, there have been the usual visual updates, and more updates to the loading script to timeout after five seconds.This is also the release of the Extended 4.1 version with a few bug fixes.[Get 'em](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf).
