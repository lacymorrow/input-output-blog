I have, for the first time, created an account at [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com)'s online photo service for myself, and decided to do something with the monstrous API I now have at my fingertips. My first invention is Viewr, a slight disappointment. It has something different than other flash programs using this API, a small size. Viewer is barely over 1kb and is entirely made of code, not a single object or layer. In seventy-five lines of code, it becomes a very customizable photo viewer for up to a hundred photos, searchable by user, photoset, or tag. It is not very pretty and can only be placed in a perfect square to work properly, so if you would like to try to make it better, I can post the code.
