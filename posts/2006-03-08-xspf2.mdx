I've been messing around with Amazon API with different types of dynamic searching. So far the coolest thing I have found is Mario Klingemann's [AmazonExplorer](http://www.quasimondo.com/amazonExplorer.php) at [Quasimondo.com](http://www.quasimondo.com). I used the API to conquer my lack-of-time problem with finding artist pictures for every band in my XSPF player. I put the picture viewer back into the player, and loaded just one URL into each track for a cool graphic, that had nothing to do with the band. Now the player automatically queries Amazon and inserts the most likely image for that band in the player. [See it Here](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf).
