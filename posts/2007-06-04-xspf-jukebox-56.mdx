A small Jukebox update to accompany my move to a new server, with a couple of bug fixes, and a couple of new features as well. The shuffle function now uses a randomized array, instead of a totally random number, which means that, while your music will come randomly, the order stays the same as you scroll through, much like in iTunes.

The fancier part of the update is the inclusion of almost full keyboard control over the player. The Left and Right arrow keys change tracks forward and backward, and when used in combination with the Shift key seeks through a track. The Up and Down arrow keys control the volume, the Spacebar Plays/Pauses, and the Control key (Command on a Mac) switches through combinations of Repeat and Shuffle. (the flash movie needs focus to enable keyboard control, this can be done through external scripts, or by the user clicking on the movie).[](http://blog.lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf-jukebox/)
