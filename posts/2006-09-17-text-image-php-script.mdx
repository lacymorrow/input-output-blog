I have uploaded my dynamic image script, for use with blogs or websites. Ever get tired of having to use system fonts for all of your webpages? Then Don't! This script takes your desired text, size, and any ".ttf" font and creates an image so that the end user does not have to see Times. Download [here](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/).
