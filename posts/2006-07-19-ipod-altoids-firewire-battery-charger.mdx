[![charger](images/193191036_b0d2d95717_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/60302584@N00/193191036/ "photo sharing") A successful experiment, I followed a tutorial over at [unixmonkey.net](http://www.unixmonkey.net/articles/altoids/ "Unixmonkey") for building an iPod charger that runs off of two AA and two 9v batteries. This should charge a 3rd generation iPod from dead to full at least twice. Sorry about the lack of pictures, I thought of photos after I had hot glued the case shut.
