Windows users, your time is gone. The Macintosh [BootCamp](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/) beta was released today, eliminating any reason to keep a faulty PC around. BootCamp allows any intel Mac running 10.4.6 or over install and run the WindowsXP operating system, separate from OSX, on the same machine. This allows full access to any and all windows programs, while keeping the speed and reliability of your Macintosh partition. The windows fix for Macintosh has been around for over a year, [PearPC](http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/). So now you can go ahead and buy that new iMac you've had you eye on. NOTE: Windows, being what it is, is still susceptible to viruses. They will not, however, affect your Macintosh partition.
