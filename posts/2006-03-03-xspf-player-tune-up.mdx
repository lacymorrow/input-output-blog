I discovered yesterday the [XSPF Web Music Player](http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net/), made by Fabricio Zuardi: a clean looking, playlist based music player that loads from XSPF (XML Shareable Playlist Format) playlists. It contains alot of the items I have in my Jukebox Player, give and take a few. I decided I could give the dreary looking player a little boost, [so I did](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf). I added a clickable and draggable timeplace bar, Shuffle and Random buttons, an alphabetize playlist option, and a few extra start options. I also cleaned up his code a bit. However, I took out the picture viewer because as of now I don't like having to insert each URL manually. I can't post the code right now because of possible copywright infringements. I'll have to check later.
