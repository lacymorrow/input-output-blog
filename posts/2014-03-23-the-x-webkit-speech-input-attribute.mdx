Google is always at the bleeding edge of web development standards, so it's not surprising that voice recognition capabilities are turned on by default in all new versions of their Chrome browser. Web developers can take advantage of it today with the `x-webkit-speech` input attribute. Just add it to any text input like so:

`<code><input type="text" x-webkit-speech />`

and visitors to your page using Chrome will be presented with an extra microphone button in the search box.

Right now this is a Chrome-only feature but likely will become supported by all popular browsers over time.
