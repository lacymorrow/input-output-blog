It seems I posted too quickly. I found a two very small, very hard-to-find bugs on the XSPF player, but there nonetheless. I fixed those, and also added a few extras while I was at it. Mainly scroll wheel use. Which doesn't work all the time. Weird. But not important. Also changed the Volume and Timebars to use the regular cursor. Makes it look more professional. If anyone knows about the mouse wheel, I'd be interested. [Here](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf).
