This post marks my first useful program for the Windows platform (besides Blackjack of course). The Xspf Jukebox Playlist Creator, as the name states, isÂ  used to create and edit Xspf and Xml playlist files for use with the Xspf Jukebox. Files are automatically parsed and labeled using their id3 tag info, both version 1 and 2 are supported. Images are also added automatically to the best fitting song, if the image name matches a songs Creator, Title, or Filename. The Creator supports both importing and exporting of playlist files. Feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, or criticisms. In the works is a Cocoa version for Mac OSX, and a Skin Creator to allow anyone to create visually appealing skins for the player.Updates for both the Xspf Jukebox and Gallery are coming soon.This project is no longer supported.
