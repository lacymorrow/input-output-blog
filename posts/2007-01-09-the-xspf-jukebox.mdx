Thats right, the 'XSPF Web Music Player' is no more, my jukebox has been completely rewritten, losing the last snippits of code from Fabricio Zuardi's original. The Jukebox is fully skinnable, every function previously available has been recoded to support skinning and resizing. The first skin, iPod Black, is a partial demo of what is possible. It supports both audio and video, and works the same way as the normal player. There are 3 files associated with the player, the actual swf file, which while having around 400 extra lines of code, has been cleaned up so that it is the same size as the Xspf, a measly 16kb. Next is the skin.xml file, which contains the instructions for creating the player look, and lastly is the background image. There are two versions, a Flash 7 version for higher browser support, or a Flash 8 version for PNG and alpha channel support. As of now there is no download, but in the next few days I will be remaking my website to support the posting, previewing, and downloading of skins, as well as releasing a few more of my own skins. As for player updates, I will be adding an image loader for greater image options (resize, rotate, color change). The one drawback I can find is in the font display, the user must have your specified font on their computer to view the player correctly, otherwise they will see the default system font (usually Times New Roman). There has only been one function addition, and that is the ability for the alphabetize function to disregard a 'The' at the beggining of an artist title, the same way iTunes does. For example, 'The Beatles' would come alphabetically before 'Cake'. To turn this off, and alphabetize normally, pass the variable 'forceAlphabetize=1'.
