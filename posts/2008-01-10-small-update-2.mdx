It's been awhile, but I am slowly getting things worked out. This is a small update to allow for a duration variable in the playlist. This fixes the "Jumpy" scrub bar, but inserting the wrong number will cause unexpected results. Use the <duration> tag in the playlist, and insert \[number of seconds\] x 1000.
