A couple of much needed bug fixes: this update fixes the stop on completion bug, the autoresume works with the pause function correctly now, and the scrolling playlist has been touched up to scroll to the correct place. For those interested in internet radio, the memory leak problem cannot be easily fixed with AS2, the coding used in this player. I am looking into a multi-track workaround which would be crude at best, but would work. [XSPF Jukebox](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf)
