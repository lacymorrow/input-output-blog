I recently went back to my old jukebox and found enough motivation to remake the entire thing, this time in a well coded, not horribly sloppy manner, truly customizable. I beefed up my actionscripting, set my mind, and created exactly what I was looking for. Sweet. Not the most beautiful graphics, but it works. And as stated, every bit, every color, buttons, bars, text, alpha fades, EVERYTHING. It loads from two XML files, beginning with an info file, and continuing with a playlist. Sadly though, the info XML file is much too complicated for a regular person with no XML skill to work with. Which was the purpose or being easily editable, so others could use it free. Remind me to post the source later.
