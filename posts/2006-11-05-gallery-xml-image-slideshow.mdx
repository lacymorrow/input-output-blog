This is the first showing of my XML slideshow. Created for, already in use at IACMusic.com, and gratefully allowed to become open-source, Gallery is an advanced image viewer with support for many customizable items, through an XML playlist. Options are title, random transition, shuffle, startimage, duration, captions, links, watermark, resizing, list, controls, looping, and autoplay. Right now it contains 11 transitions; "fade", "bars", "blinds", "blocks", "checker", "circles", "dissolve", "fadewhite", "fluids", "move", "moveout", "wipe". Many include extra random changes to a singular transition to get a total of 43 transitions. This is not yet available for download yet, but a demonstration has been placed.
