Another moderately big update. Many tiny bug fixes, and one big update: Time Display! The variable to insert the display is "timedisplay" and the possible values are 1, 2, 3, or 4 for the three different types. This adds an iTunes-esque timedisplay on the music label bar, beside volume. The outcomes of the values are as follows: 2 = a countup timer, from 0:00 until the song is finished. 3 = a countdown, until 0:00. 4 displays the total time in the song/video (yes it works for video too). 1 will be the most used value, it creates a button that can be clicked to switch between the three display types. Just add "timedisplay=1" to your url to see exactly what I mean.Â [](http://blog.lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf-wmp/)
