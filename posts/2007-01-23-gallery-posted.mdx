The download to my Flash XML image slideshow has been posted. Gallery is open-source, and is one of the most advanced image slideshows on the web. Make use of titles, captions, audio, watermarks, alpha channels, and most of all, transitions. There are 13 current transitions, with more on the way, as well as subsets of some transitions, to make over 43 possible effects. [Get it here](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/).
