Finally, a full writeup on using the Xspf Jukebox has been completed, and should help solve many problems that people have been having. Next to come is a "skin.xml" writeup, on how to create skins, and applications to automate embedding. On another note, a new version of the Jukebox has been released, with minor bug fixes and a couple of changes: the player will no longer connect to Amazon to retrieve images unless the "findImage" variable is set to true. Id3 tags will be used if no creator, title, or annotation is present. The "skin\_url" is no longer the xml file, but the folder containing your skin. Single tracks now use the two parameters "track\_url" and "track\_title" in the place of "song\_url" and "song\_title". The download should be available in the next few days with the skins, or if you can't wait, it is already in the source download.
