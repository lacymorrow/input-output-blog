# TypeScript quirks

There are some quirks in TypeScript that are not obvious at first glance.

## `tsconfig.json` `include` and `exclude` properties

**Globbing does not work as expected.** This does not work:

```json
{
	"include": ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"]
}
```

This does:

```json
{
	"include": ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
}
```

## `keyof` operator

The `keyof` operator in TypeScript is a bit different than in JavaScript. In JavaScript, `keyof` is a unary operator that returns an array of strings representing the keys of its operand. In TypeScript, `keyof` is a type operator that returns a union of string literal types representing the keys of its operand. This is useful for getting the keys of an object, or for extracting the keys from a type.

```ts
type Person = {
	name: string;
	age: number;
};

type PersonKeys = keyof Person; // "name" | "age"

const person: Person = {
	name: "John",
	age: 42,
};

type PersonKeysType = keyof typeof person; // "name" | "age"
```

## `typeof` operator

The `typeof` operator in TypeScript is a bit different than in JavaScript. In JavaScript, `typeof` is a unary operator that returns a string representing the type of its operand. In TypeScript, `typeof` is a type operator that returns the type of its operand. This is useful for getting the type of a variable or property, or for extracting the type from a function signature.

```ts
type Person = {
	name: string;
	age: number;
};

type PersonName = Person["name"]; // string
type PersonAge = Person["age"]; // number

const person: Person = {
	name: "John",
	age: 42,
};

type PersonNameType = typeof person["name"]; // string
type PersonAgeType = typeof person["age"]; // number
```
