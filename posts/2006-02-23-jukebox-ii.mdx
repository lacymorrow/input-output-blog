I found a few changes in my jukebox that could be remedied and have been. The new jukebox is here. I made a short splash screen for slow XML loaders, error messages, a highlight bar, shuffle and repeat buttons, a pause button, timeplace slider and a half working pop-up button (I didn't really test it, but turned it off and forgot about it). Works pretty good, some kid even offered to pay me to use it on their myspace, unfortunately, myspace blocks OBJECT tags so that was over quickly.
