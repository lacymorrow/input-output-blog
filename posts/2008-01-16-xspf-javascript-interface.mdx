Some of you have been asking for a way to control the Xspf Jukebox using Javascript, well here it is. A single line of code is all it takes to play, pause stop, switch between tracks, and toggle shuffle and repeat on/off. These are the only six functions available at this time, but I am open to suggestions for additional ones. The documentation has been updated for reference [here](https://github.com/lacymorrow/xspf-jukebox).
