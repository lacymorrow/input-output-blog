Taking an old Xbox controller that I previously put a female usb port into (for flash drive use), I stripped the female head off, and added a male connector. Using an Xbox driver off the internet, it is possible to use an Xbox controller as a gamepad. Combine that with a good MMOFPS or a good N64 emulator and you have years of fun on your hands
