I've restructured and reorganized [lacymorrow.com](http://www.lacymorrow.com/ "Lacy Morrow"). You can find all of my old projects including the XSPF Jukebox to [lacymorrow.com/projects/](http://www.lacymorrow.com/projects/ "Projects"). You may also notice that this blog has a newer, cleaner look. I am now running the [Casper](https://github.com/lacymorrow/casper-wp) theme that I developed as a Wordpress port of the [Ghost](http://ghost.org) blogging platform's default theme.
