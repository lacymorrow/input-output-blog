I am now accepting submissions of your own Jukebox skins to share with others. Zip all skin files and visit lacymorrow.com/projects/jukebox/upload/ Email to submit skins to the site. All skins will be approved by myself before being posted on the site. Also the [XSPF Jukebox](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf) page now shows the contents of the informational tags in the skin.xml file.
