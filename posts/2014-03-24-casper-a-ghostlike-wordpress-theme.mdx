Today I am releasing an early version of my new [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) theme, [Casper](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/casper/).

Casper is a direct port of the [Ghost](http://ghost.org) blogging platform default theme by the same name. It is a gorgeously simple, one column theme that transitions nicely to mobile devices. The idea behind this project was to emulate the original theme exactly, then work to add features exclusive to Wordpress. So far the theme supports media-specific image loading via [responsive-img.js](https://github.com/kvendrik/responsive-images.js), a single widget area above the footer, a social icons section, and many options available through the Wordpress customizer.
