Ok, so I've heard of the countless problems people are having getting the Jukebox up and running, as well as the number of bugs yet to be fixed. Believe me, every single email and comment is read. The main reason for lack of support and updates is that I don't have the time. With school starting back and my eighteenth birthday coming up, I have had to concentrate more on my paid web design projects than the Jukebox. That is not to say that the project will be dropped, in fact I have every intention of recreating the entire website as well as making a simple auto-installer for the Jukebox. My only compensation for these projects are from the minimal donations I receive, so be happy with the current version. And also get ready, I have big plans for the Jukebox over the next month or so, so check back to see how it is coming. The Xspf Jukebox is already the most functional web media player on the internet (take that, WimpyPlayer), and the best part: It's free. So if you are having problems, leave a comment, or shoot me an email (just make sure to send me a link, I can't help you if I can't see what's wrong). Also, check out theÂ [project page](http://www.lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf/). You can download the files exactly as I have them used and, who knows? Maybe you'll solve the problems yourself.
