The first Xspf Jukebox update in a couple of months, to celebrate my 17th. This update fixes all of the bugs that have been brought to my attention, as well as adding some new features. Some changes include autoresume carrying the paused state, as well as the shuffled playlist order, through a refresh. Repeating track and playlist problems have been resolved, as well as internet radio issues. New additions include a scrolling playlist to show the current track, a play state display for skins (shows play/pause/stop icon), and a customizable format for track labels using the "format" variable. Just type exactly how you would like each track label to appear, using "-creator", "-title", "-location", and "-annotation" to insert their respective values. For example, "Playing: -title by -creator" could output "Playing: The General by Dispatch".
