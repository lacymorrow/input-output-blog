The download for the Xspf Jukebox has been posted. I have worked hard to create a dynamic php download session, so that instead of downloading every file, a .tar.gz package is created on-the-fly, containing only the requested skin file and the necessary swf file. I also created a php display to automatically find and display all skins on the site. As always, you can find a link to all of the source files, as well as an example on how to create your own skins. In the works is a skin upload page, for user-submitted skins, and a skin creator, to help in creating them. For right now, if you would like your skin displayed and available for download, email me the skin.xml and images folder, containing all used images. Remember to use relative urls when creating skins, (ex: image="images/ipodblack.png"). [XSPF Jukebox](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf)
