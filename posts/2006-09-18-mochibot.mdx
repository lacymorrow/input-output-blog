I have been getting some emails from people finding "suspicious Mochibot code" in my flash files. [Mochibot](http://www.mochibot.com "Mochibot") code is non-invasive and is used onlyÂ as a tracker for my flash projects, it shows me where and how many times my videos have been played. I would apreciate it if developers would leave the code standing, but if needed, I have no problem with any removal of it.
