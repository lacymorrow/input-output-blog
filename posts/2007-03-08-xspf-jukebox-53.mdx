The Xspf Jukebox has been updated with a few new functions, including an autoresume feature based on [Thomas Boutell](http://www.boutell.com/xspf/)'s additions on my old player. The function works worse than would be appreciated, but works nonetheless. You can activate it by using the variable 'autoresume'. A second addition is the ability to choose a highlight color for the currently playing song. Use the tag 'selectedColor' inside the skin. [XSPF Jukebox](http://lacymorrow.com/projects/xspf)
