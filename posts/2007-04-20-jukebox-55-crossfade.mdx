New updates for the Xspf Jukebox. I have fixed some minor bugs with skin processing, as well as adding a new option for aligning the track display text using the tag "align" inside the skin.xml file (options, of course, are "left", "right", and default is "center"). Two new variables, one more exciting than the other. The first is the "midChar" variable, which gives you the option to change the character separating creator and title in the track label. The second controls the new Crossfade function, much like iTunes. Use the variable "crossFade", set to either a boolean value (true or false), which will default to six seconds, or fill in a number (in seconds) 1 through 12.
