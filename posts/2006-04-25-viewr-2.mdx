Keeping with tradition, Viewr 2 is released completely comprised of code. 190 lines of it to be exact. Many revisions, mostly being the fade effect between photos, along the ability to pause, play, and skip ahead. Also a few more customizable features, such as delay, link url, and controls. Another good upgrade: a preloader. Pictures still may be a little jumpy at times, but at least they wont be eight second loading. I will post source and file as soon as I finish documentation.
