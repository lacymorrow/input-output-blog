This is the second edition of my dynamic Flash slideshow, Gallery. Not having been updated in a good five months, this version fills in the gaping holes in code missing from the last version. Many things have been tweaked and updated, the visuals and animations included. There are a couple off new transitions, and additions of easing tweens for 14 total transitions with subsets to give up to 101 possible effects. The control box is now working perfectly, along with keyboard control. Use the arrow keys and the spacebar to cycle through images, pause, and play. Add music, a watermark, and as many images as possible through an easily customizable XML interface. (the flash movie needs focus to enable keyboard control, this can be done through external scripts, or by the user clicking on the movie). Flickr support has now been added as well, fully customizable as to what pictures are shown, yet simple to implement. The documentation will be updated shortly.
