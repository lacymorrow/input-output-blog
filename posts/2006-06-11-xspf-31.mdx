New XSPF update, very minor changes. The auto-update was checking version with an onEnterFrame function for the entire time the player is running, taking up a little more cpu than necessary. Also, the info tags from the playlist have been getting overwritten by a link to my site (the default if there is no info tag) before being loaded.
