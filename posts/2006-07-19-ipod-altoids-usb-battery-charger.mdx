[![charger](images/193191032_af5ee8a895_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/60302584@N00/193191032/ "photo sharing") For the 98% of people without a 3rd generation iPod, I have created a smaller USB charger for just about every other type of iPod. This time without a tutorial, I wired a 9v battery clip to an on/off switch, then to a 5v regulator, to a nice blue 5v LED, to a USB port, all in series. Everything can be bought at RadioShack for under five dollars, except for the USB connector, which I bought from [digikey.com](http://www.digikey.com "digikey"). A breadboard helps, but is not necessary.
